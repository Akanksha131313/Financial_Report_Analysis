Project Overview -> 
- This project involves a comprehensive analysis of financial reports to derive insights about company performance, profitability, and financial health. The aim is to identify key trends, evaluate financial ratios, and visualize critical metrics to support decision-making for stakeholders.
- Financial data from multiple sources (like balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements) has been processed, analyzed, and visualized to uncover patterns and anomalies.

-- Objectives
    i)Analyze company financial reports to identify trends and insights.
    ii) Compute and interpret key financial ratios (liquidity, profitability, leverage, efficiency).
    iii) Visualize financial data for easier understanding and reporting.
    iv) Highlight areas of financial strength and risk for informed decision-making.

--Tools & Technologies
    i) Python: Data processing, analysis, and visualization (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn).
    ii) Excel: Initial data cleaning and preliminary analysis.
    iii) Tableau: Interactive dashboards for visualization and presentation.
    iv) GitHub: Project repository and version control.

--Methodology
